Implementing GP-UCB in Jax
==========================

Here I'll showcase the capabilities of the Jax framework to
solve some interesting problems. We will be implementing the
Gaussian Process-Upper Confidence Bound algorithm which is
often used to solve the Bayesian Optimization problem.

In this problem, we have some function
\(f: \mathbb{R}^d \mapsto \mathbb{R}\)
